Skeleton of a basic monitoring system -- the agent
can be dumped on various machines...and run minutely
from cron.  This outputs hourly log files, grouped
into daily directories.

The logfiles are rsync'd to a central server and a
simple viewer webapp lets us look at the logs / metric
summaries, graphs etc.

So far:

- simple agent that does 10 pings and logs the 
  # of successful pings, the min/avg/max RTT.
- a dumb sinatra webapp that lets you browse the
  logs and graphs the metrics in a single hourly
  log using the google charts API.
